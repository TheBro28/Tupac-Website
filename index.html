    <h2>About Tupac (The Prophet) Shakur</h2>

    <p><strong>Tupac Amaru Shakur</strong>(/tu:pa:k ʃə'kʊər/)ⓘ; born Lesane Parish Crooks; June 16, 1971 - September 13, 1996, also known by his stage names <em>2Pac</em> and <em>Makaveli</em>, was an American
         rapper and actor. He is regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time, one of the most influential musical artists of the 20th century, and a prominent political
         activist for Black America. <em>He is among the best-selling music artists</em>, having sold more than <strong>75 million records worldwide</strong>. Shakur's music addresses social injustice,
          political issues, and the marginalization of African Americans, though he was also synonymous with gangsta rap and violent lyrics.</p>

        <p>Shakur was born in New York City to parents who were Black Panther Party members. Raised by his mother, <strong>Afeni Shakur</strong>, he relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area 
        in 1988. His debut album <em>2Pacalypse</em> Now (1991) cemented him as a central figure in West Coast hip-hop for his political rap lyrics. Shakur achieved further
         critical and commercial success with his subsequent albums <em>Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...</em> (1993) and <em>Me Against the World</em> (1995).
         His Diamond-certified album <em>All Eyez on Me</em> (1996), the first hip-hop double album, abandoned introspective lyrics for volatile gangsta rap.
          It yielded two yielded two Billboard Hot 100-number one singles, <strong>"California Love"</strong> and <strong>"How Do U Want It"</strong>. Alongside his solo career,
          Shakur was part of the group <strong><em>Thug Life</em></strong> and collaborated with artists like Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and Outlawz. As an actor, Shakur starred in the films Juice (1992),
           Poetic Justice (1993), Above the Rim (1994), Bullet (1996), Gridlock'd (1997), and Gang Related (1997).</p>
        
        <p>During his later career, Shakur was shot five times in the lobby of a New York recording studio and experienced legal troubles, including incarceration.
         He served eight months in prison on sexual abuse charges, but was released pending appeal in 1995.[10] Following his release,
          he signed to Marion "Suge" Knight's label Death Row Records and became embroiled in the East Coast–West Coast hip-hop rivalry,[11] which included a high-profile
           feud with his former friend the Notorious B.I.G. On September 7, 1996, Shakur was shot four times by an unidentified assailant in a drive-by shooting in Paradise,
            Nevada; he died six days later. Rumors circulated suggesting that the Notorious B.I.G. was involved; he was murdered in another drive-by shooting 
            six months later in March 1997, while visiting Los Angeles.[12][13]</p>
        
        <p>Shakur's double-length posthumous album Greatest Hits (1998) is one of his two releases—and one of only nine hip-hop albums—to have been certified Diamond
         in the United States.[14] Five more albums have been released since Shakur's death, including the acclaimed The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory (1996)[15] 
         under the stage name Makaveli, all of which have been certified multi-platinum in the United States.[16] In 2002, Shakur was inducted into the Hip-Hop Hall of Fame.
         [17] In 2017, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility.[18] Rolling Stone ranked Shakur among the 100 Greatest Artists
          of All Time.[19] In 2023, he was awarded a posthumous star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[20] His influence in music, activism, songwriting,
           and other areas of culture has been the subject of academic studies.[21][22]</p>

    <h2>Why I love Tupac (The Prophet) Shakur</h2>

    <p>Tupac often raps about real world problems and connects his lyrics to the everyday problems people face in society. In one of his hit songs called “THUG LIFE”,
         he talks about various types of racism and how systems are built to disadvantage certain people. This song gives people from different backgrounds
          a lot of insight on what people have to deal with in today’s society and that’s something not too common nowadays. Lots of people including me love Tupac for his
           raw honesty, relatability, poetic lyrics, and his clear willingness to address social issues. Personally, I find Tupac to be a lyrical genius.</p>
